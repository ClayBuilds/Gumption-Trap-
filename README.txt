GUMPTION TRAP

This project is open source, free for anyone to use for whatever you want. 
I coded/designed/built all this purely for hobby purposes and I'm happy to help others build onto it for their own projects.

Check out my youtube channel for a few videos explaining this stuff in action:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnwIEK_l8J-6gFpHYlkmyig
or look up "Clay Builds" (@Clay-Builds) on youtube if that link doesn't work. 

My website is https://www.clay-p-mcpherson.com/ 
It might have some bonus pictures and stuff but it mostly just links to the youtube channel.
